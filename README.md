# Ouroboros: Human‑Led Recursive Reinforcement Learning for Autoregressive Language Models

## Overview

Ouroboros is a novel, human-led recursive reinforcement learning (HLRR) method designed for fine-tuning and aligning autoregressive large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), Ouroboros implements a continuous, cyclic interaction between a human supervisor and the language model. This interaction iteratively integrates human evaluation, persona coherence, and logical consistency into the model’s outputs, achieving superior alignment with significantly reduced human annotation overhead.

## Methodology: Ouroboros Loop

The Ouroboros cycle comprises the following steps, continuously refining model alignment:
1. Human-Model Interaction: Dialogue generation between human and LLM.
2. Distilled Human Summaries: Condensation of dialogues into structured summaries (facts, logical flows, persona snapshots).
3. Labyrinth Prompts: Complex rephrasings of summaries designed to challenge and test model coherence and consistency.
4. Regeneration and Scoring: Model responses are regenerated, assessed, and scored by the human supervisor.
5. Policy Gradient Updates: Adjust model parameters via PPO-based reinforcement updates, refining alignment iteratively.

## Compatibility

* Framework: PyTorch, Transformers
* Language models tested: GPT-J (6B), Llama 2 (70B), GPT-4o (via API)
* Hardware requirements: M1 Max, or equivalent hardware.

## Upcoming Features & Improvements

* Public release of PyTorch implementation
* Additional benchmarking datasets
* Integration of a multi-teacher variant
* Community-sourced annotated examples

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

Ouroboros fine-tunes models toward the preferences of a specific human supervisor. Caution must be exercised, especially in sensitive use cases (e.g., educational or therapeutic applications). Ongoing red-teaming and validation are essential.
