Ouroboros: Human‑Led Recursive Reinforcement Learning for Autoregressive Language Models


⸻

🚧 Overview

Ouroboros is a novel, human-led recursive reinforcement learning (HLRR) method designed for fine-tuning and aligning autoregressive large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), Ouroboros implements a continuous, cyclic interaction between a human supervisor and the language model. This interaction iteratively integrates human evaluation, persona coherence, and logical consistency into the model’s outputs, achieving superior alignment with significantly reduced human annotation overhead.

This repository contains:
	•	The original scientific paper describing the Ouroboros method.
	•	Implementation details (PyTorch-based, upcoming).
	•	Annotated examples and evaluation frameworks for reproducibility.
	•	Benchmarking datasets and evaluation results.

	•	Status: Under submission for peer review; preprint forthcoming on arXiv.

Abstract: Ouroboros integrates human supervision into reinforcement learning loops, enhancing long-horizon factual accuracy, reducing reward-model exploits, and converging rapidly toward a coherent persona alignment. Our results indicate significant improvements over traditional RLHF methods, with substantially fewer required human annotations.

🔄 Methodology: Ouroboros Loop

The Ouroboros cycle comprises the following steps, continuously refining model alignment:
	1.	Human-Model Interaction: Dialogue generation between human and LLM.
	2.	Distilled Human Summaries: Condensation of dialogues into structured summaries (facts, logical flows, persona snapshots).
	3.	Labyrinth Prompts: Complex rephrasings of summaries designed to challenge and test model coherence and consistency.
	4.	Regeneration and Scoring: Model responses are regenerated, assessed, and scored by the human supervisor.
	5.	Policy Gradient Updates: Adjust model parameters via PPO-based reinforcement updates, refining alignment iteratively.

🧪 Experimental Results

Ouroboros was benchmarked against baseline RL methods on three key dimensions:

Metric	Supervised FT	RLHF	RLAIF	Ouroboros (ours)
Factual F1 Score (%) ↑	72.1	78.4	79.0	86.3
Persona Consistency (%) ↑	54.7	68.9	66.2	84.5
Reward Exploits (/100) ↓	23	14	12	7
Human Minutes / 1k reward pairs ↓	—	105	37	5

Ouroboros achieves significant improvements in alignment and consistency, requiring less human effort than competing approaches.

💡 Ethical Considerations and Limitations

Ouroboros fine-tunes models toward the preferences of a specific human supervisor. Caution must be exercised, especially in sensitive use cases (e.g., educational or therapeutic applications). Ongoing red-teaming and validation are essential.
